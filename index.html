              <p>I decided to take the C#/React course from Epicodus for a few reasons. The first of which, is that I have been working in the restaurant industry most of my life, and while the work is rewarding and enjoyable, the opportunities through which I can support my family and few and far between. The field also requires an incredible amount of time and dedication, which I no longer see as worthwhile, when compared to what I miss out on with my family while pursuing it. The second is that I love Design work, and being creative. I have been goofing around with p5.js, a creative coding library, for a while and its really fun and inspiring. The work also allows me to share an office space with my wife, who also plans to work in the tech field. We are hopeful that the remote work fad will stick around for a while, (potentially forever!) as businesses learn to recognize the cost effectiveness of home offices. And lastly, as a Jewish person working in the restaurant industry, taking Friday nights off to celebrate Shabbos with my family was difficult or impossible, and I look forward to living a more observant life with the schedule of a tech worker. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
